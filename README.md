If using the non-background scripts to toggle mouse speed, you'll likely want to create a shortcut to both .bat files.

After creating the shortcut, change the properties of the shortcut to start the application minimized and set a hotkey. 

You will want to assign the hotkey to Control + the key you'd like to press for reasons obvious to anybody who uses Windows Mouse Keys with RuneScape.

By doing these things, the bat files will run in the background while you continue to play.
